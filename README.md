🎮 Excited to share my latest project: A Web-based Hand Cricket Game! 🏏
This project is a fun, interactive hand cricket game where players can choose to either bat or bowl against the computer. The game keeps track of scores, overs, and wickets, and alternates between batting and bowling until the final result is announced. Whether you win, lose, or tie, the game displays a dynamic outcome with animations!

💻 Features:
Toss and Choice: Players can start by choosing either batting or bowling after a virtual toss.
Interactive Gameplay:
Players select runs by clicking buttons with different run options (1 to 6).
The computer randomly selects its score for each delivery.
Score Tracking: The game continuously updates both the user’s and computer’s scores and tracks the number of balls, overs, and wickets.
End Result: At the end of the game, animations and messages display the final result—whether it’s a win, loss, or tie.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and visually appealing design with real-time updates and animations to enhance the gaming experience.
🛠 Technologies Used:
HTML: To structure the game layout.
CSS: For styling the interface and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: To handle the game logic, user interactions, and real-time score updates.
This project was a great way to practice my web development skills and apply logic in a fun setting. Check out the code on GitHub 🔗 (https://anikesh-tech.github.io/Hand-Cricket-Game/)and try it out for yourself!
